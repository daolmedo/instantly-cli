<p>Hey {{firstName}},</p>
<p>Great to hear you're interested in giving EasyVC a try!</p>
<p>When you create your EasyVC account (Sign In button), you can type in the description of your company, set your target investor type, round stage and region. The AI will then start the search and match you with potential investors.</p>
<p>The free demo gives you a preview of the first 3 investors, including details like the AI's reasoning, their description, contact info, portfolio companies, and even a warm intro pipeline.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes!</p>
<p>Best,<br>Daniel</p>
