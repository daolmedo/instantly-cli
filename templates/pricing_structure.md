# Pricing Structure

## When to use

The lead has specifically asked about pricing, costs, or plans. They want to know what they'll pay. Give the full breakdown of both plans plus the custom outreach service, and end with a calendar link to book a call.

Hi {{First Name}},

Happy to answer your question with a quick breakdown!

We offer two pricing options:
$119.99 per month: This plan adds 25 new investors to your pipeline each month, complete with contact info, activity reports, AI reasoning for the match, and a subpipeline of portfolio founders for warm intros.
$89.99 per month (billed annually): This gives you unlimited AI investor matches and access to all EasyVC features. Plus, we provide 1-on-1 coaching sessions on your fundraising process.
Ultimately, the choice depends on which option best aligns with your fundraising goals.

In addition to these plans, we also offer a complementary custom service where a person from our team uses EasyVC and handles the entire outreach process to portfolio founders for you on LinkedIn, and schedules meetings directly with them. If you'd like to explore this further, happy to do so in more detail.

Happy to chat more over a call, here's my calendar:
